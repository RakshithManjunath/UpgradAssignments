# Bike Sharing Assignment 
The bike sharing assignment involved analyzing a dataset of bike sharing data to predict the demand for shared bikes. The dataset was preprocessed, explored, and used to build a linear regression model to predict the bike demand based on various factors such as weather, season, and time.

## General Information
- The business problem being solved in bike sharing is to accurately predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant variables. By predicting the demand, bike sharing companies can optimize their operations, ensure the availability of bikes when and where they are needed, and improve the overall user experience. 
- The dataset being used is bike sharing dataset.
